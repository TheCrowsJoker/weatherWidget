# weatherWidget

This is a weather program written in java and using javafx for GUI elements.

It pulls data from Metservice in JSON format and makes use of Googles own GSON library (https://github.com/google/gson) to parse it into java objects and arrays.

This data is then displayed in a javafx window with tabs for todays, tomorrows, and the weeks weather in simple formatting.
